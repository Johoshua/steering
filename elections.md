# Kubernetes Steering Committee Elections

This document outlines the process, for steering committee elections.


### Eligibility for voting

Eligibility to vote for steering committee members will be defined by:

* People who have at least 50 [contributions to the Kubernetes project over the past year as defined by devstats](https://k8s.devstats.cncf.io/d/13/developer-activity-counts-by-repository-group?orgId=1&var-period_name=Last%20year&var-metric=contributions&var-repogroup_name=All) as of 2018-08-15
* People who have submitted the [voting exception form] and are accepted by
  the election committee. Acceptance will be defined by a simple majority
  vote, and the criteria used during this process will be used to help refine
  further elections.

It is the responsibility of the steering committee to refine these criteria prior
to each election.

### Eligibility for candidacy

Anyone may nominate either themselves or someone else to be a candidate in the
election. To be ratified as a candidate, the nominee must accept the nomination
and three Members of Standing (including the nominator, if she/he has standing)
from three different employers, must endorse the nomination.

Nominators are free to nominate as many people as they wish to. Members of
Standing may endorse multiple nominees, but we expect endorsements to be in
good faith.  If this turns out to be a problem, this will be reconsidered.

### Election process

Elections will be held using time-limited Condorcet ranking on CIVS. The top
vote getters will be elected to the respective positions.

### Maximal representation

To encourage diversity there will be a maximum of one-third representation on
the Steering Committee from any one company at any time. If the results of an
election result in greater than 1/3 representation, the lowest vote getters
from any particular company will be removed until representation on the
committee is less than one-third.

If percentages shift because of job changes, acquisitions, or other events,
sufficient members of the committee must resign until max one-third
representation is achieved. If it is impossible to find sufficient members to
resign, the entire company’s representation will be removed and new special
elections held. In the event of a question of company membership (for example
evaluating independence of corporate subsidiaries) a majority of all
non-involved Steering Committee members will decide.

### Terms and election cycles

Steering committee members are elected to serve two year terms, with roughly
half of the elected members coming up for re-election each year for purposes
of continuity.  This staggered election cycle was bootstrapped in 2017 by
cutting the terms of the lowest vote getters to one year.

## Election schedule and operation

The steering committee picks election officers to operate the election and
circulate a timeline for nominations, and the vote. At present because results
are announced early October, the steering committee should start looking at
this process by mid-July, planning to kick things off by mid-August. This
process is articulated in [kubernetes/community/elections/README.md].

### Vacancies

In the event of a resignation or other loss of a steering committee member, the
candidate with the next most votes from the previous election will be offered
the seat.  This process will continue until the seat is filled.  In case this
fails to fill the seat, a special election for that position will be held as
soon as possible. The same group of people as described in “eligibility for
voting” will vote in the special election. A committee member elected in a
special election will serve out the remainder of the term for the person they
are replacing, regardless of the length of that remainder. If a continuity
member resigns or otherwise is lost from the Committee, that position will not
be filled.

### Limiting Corporate Campaigning

To reduce size of company advantages, candidates may not use their companies
internal or external brand to campaign.  Their employers cannot solicit votes
on their behalf or sponsor candidates from partner organizations.  Simply put,
elections highlight individuals outside of their corporate role and should be
treated as “brand free” activities.

## Emeritus Term

Members of the steering committee will graduate to becoming Emeritus members of
the steering committee.

## Bootstrap recusal

Special note: The bootstrap committee pledges to recuse itself from any direct
election activities while they serve as continuity members. Members of the
bootstrap committee will refrain from endorsing or otherwise advocating for any
candidate (with the exception that the members of the bootstrap committee may
vote in the elections, and may choose to run in the 2019 election).
