# Steering Committee Bosun Guide  

This doc is a guide to help the delegated Steering Committee (SC) Member bosun
the public meeting. SC members will pick a new one for the next meeting at the
end.  

## Before
1. Create the skeleton meeting agenda from follow up items the meeting prior,
parking lot topics at the top, and ask other steering members to populate.
2. Read through the agenda just to familiarize yourself with the content to
assign timeboxes. [repeat a few times in the days leading to the meeting if it’s
 a live agenda]
3. Post the draft agenda at least 3 business days before with a call for final topics and
 a clear timebox to the kubernetes-dev and steering mailing lists. This will act as a reminder
  and put the agenda on the community’s radar, too. Ideally this would be Wednesday before the meeting and closing the agenda by Friday to give time for everyone to prepare.  
  - Note that the dev mailing list is the source of truth. While a Slack
notification is nice and helpful, the mailing list is the main communication
channel.
  - Also post to the #steering-committee, #kubernetes-dev, #chairs-and-techleads
slack channels
6. Make sure there’s someone who volunteers from contribex to act as the meeting
 host to mute folks, verify recording, note taker and other zoom admin tasks.
7. If no one steps up for note taking, you’re it.
8. Do we want to poll the attendees with any questions? Do we want to take any
live community voting for pulse checks? (not decisions)
9. DAY OF: Join ten minutes early to make sure all audio, video, and zoom
administration (including capability to record) is right. You'll need the zoom host key at the very least and to record to the cloud.  
10. Make sure that you have cleared your desktop and can be prepared to present
if needed. Sometimes AV problems will require you to step in and present.

## During
### Starting:
1. Before recording the meeting, tell the group “This is a Kubernetes meeting
that will be posted publicly on YouTube, so please be mindful that what you say
is being recorded.
2. Please also mute if you are not speaking.” Talk about the process of waiting
for n Steering members to arrive before you start. Check on [quorum]
3. Call on others to add things to the agenda and start recording
#### After recording starts:
1. Hello! Welcome! [introduce yourself]
2. Mention that we have a Code of Conduct, so be excellent to each other.
3. Ask for a note-taker if you don't have one, ask steering members to put
[steering] in their zoom display name for easy counting.
4. Keep an eye for questions in the Zoom chat.
5. Discuss that we may ask for further context, docs, etc. so that we can better
 understand larger issues or items. If there is a case where we don’t have
 enough or not prepared, we will set up a separate meeting, bump to the mailing
 list for further conversation, or bump to a next meeting.
### Mid-meeting:
1. Start with current steering projects in flight / stand up with steering folks
2. Go into specific agenda topics
3. If space, go through the open issues and PRs and do triage. Make sure everything is assigned and labeled in a  milestone that is either in the next two-month cycle or a future cycles milestone.  

## Ending:
1. At end, notify everyone the notes will be posted soon to the steering mailing list.
"Take some time to update the agenda or comment before I send it."
2. Pick the next bosun.  
3. Thank everyone for their time.  

## After:

- Clean up any parts of the agenda that got mis-formatted during the meeting.
- Set any issues and assign owners that arise from the meeting that was not covered in a triage session at the end  
- Reply to yourself on the mailing list with in-line of the notes. Also announce
 who will be hosting next month.
